I am Refactoring exsisting code to match an example that was given to me in this README.

I have added many commits to show you what I changed.

Originally when I turned this in, they said to leave the footer in order to match the example. But in the example, they had removed the footer. So  i left it out in order to be accurate.

Here are the screenshots:
